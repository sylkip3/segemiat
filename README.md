Cyberzone AI Ltd is a startup that provides AI-powered decision-making systems to UK and
US-based healthcare and fintech organisations. Their IT infrastructure comprises data
centres, network infrastructure, servers, end-user devices, software, and applications. The
company processes sensitive data, proprietary AI models, and real-time analytics systems,
which are also hosted in a hybrid cloud environment (on-premises + Azure).
Their network was recently compromised by an established hacking group, resulting in the
leakage of pre-trained models and customer datasets. The hackers were also able to
perform lateral movements across the internal network, gaining access to a significant
portion of the network. Further reports suggest that the hackers were able to export source
code repositories to unknown IP addresses. The leadership is concerned about compliance,
financial, and reputational risk to their company. As a result, they have requested that your
team conduct a security audit to assess their current security posture. They would like you
to evaluate the effectiveness of their current security controls, recommend improvements
aligned with ISO 27001:2022, and develop a robust business continuity plan.
